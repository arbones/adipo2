##### Welcome to the website of the ADIPOcyte and FAT biology Lab.

* We study adipocyte biology and its role in health and disease. Collaborating with basic and clinical researchers, we focus on the pathophysiological effects of obesity, particularly the metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progression to liver cancer. 
* Our work aims to identify biomarkers and develop approaches for personalized medicine, addressing the challenges faced by obese patients and the professionals who care for them. 
* We apply advanced omics technologies and AI tools, including large language models (LLMs), to improve our understanding and find practical solutions.
